</ul>

<p>OAuth is an open standard for authorization, commonly used as a way for Internet users to log into third party websites using their Microsoft, Google, Facebook or Twitter accounts without exposing their password.Generally, OAuth provides to clients a &#39;secure delegated access&#39; to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.[2]</p>

<li>secure non-password</li>
<li>web, mobile</li>
<li>面向 HTTP</li>
</ul>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.</p>

<p>resource owner
      An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
      When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an
      end-user.</p>

<p>resource server
      The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting
      and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.</p>

<p>client
      An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
      resource owner and with its authorization.  The term &quot;client&quot; does
      not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,
      whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other
      devices).</p>

<p>authorization server
      The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully

<p>(A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.</p>

<p>(B)  The client receives an authorization grant, which is a
        credential representing the resource owner&#39;s authorization,
        expressed using one of four grant types defined in this
        specification or using an extension grant type.  The
        authorization grant type depends on the method used by the
        client to request authorization and the types supported by the
        authorization server.</p>

<p>(C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.</p>

<p>(D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.</p>

<p>(E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.</p>

<p>(F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.</p>

<p>The preferred method for the client to obtain an authorization grant
   from the resource owner (depicted in steps (A) and (B)) is to use the
   authorization server as an intermediary, which is illustrated in</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li> Protocol Endpoints</li>
</ol>

<p>The authorization process utilizes two authorization server endpoints
   (HTTP resources):</p>

<p>o  Authorization endpoint - used by the client to obtain
      authorization from the resource owner via user-agent redirection.</p>

<p>o  Token endpoint - used by the client to exchange an authorization
      grant for an access token, typically with client authentication.</p>

<p>As well as one client endpoint:</p>

<p>o  Redirection endpoint - used by the authorization server to return
      responses containing authorization credentials to the client via
      the resource owner user-agent.</p>

<p>Not every authorization grant type utilizes both endpoints.
   Extension grant types MAY define additional endpoints as needed.</p>

<li>Implicit</li>
<li>Resource Owner Password Credentials</li>
<li>Client Credentials</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="authorization-code">Authorization Code</h2>

<p>The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its user-agent as defined in [RFC2616]), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.</p>

<p>Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code, the authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains authorization.  Because the resource owner only authenticates with the authorization server, the resource owner&#39;s credentials are never shared with the client.</p>

<p>The authorization code provides a few important security benefits, such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the transmission of the access token directly to the client without passing it through the resource owner&#39;s user-agent and potentially exposing it to others, including the resource owner.</p>

The credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client (e.g., the client is part of the device operating system or a highly privileged application), and when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an authorization code).

Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for a single request and are exchanged for an access token.  This grant type can eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner credentials for future use, by exchanging the
credentials with a long-lived access token or refresh token.

<h1 id="issuing-an-access-token">Issuing an Access Token</h1>

<p>Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the
   client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens
   represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the
   resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization
   server.</p>

<p>The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the authorization
   information or may self-contain the authorization information in a
   verifiable manner (i.e., a token string consisting of some data and a
   signature).  Additional authentication credentials, which are beyond
   the scope of this specification, may be required in order for the
   client to use a token.</p>

<p>The access token provides an abstraction layer, replacing different
   authorization constructs (e.g., username and password) with a single
   token understood by the resource server.  This abstraction enables
   issuing access tokens more restrictive than the authorization grant
   used to obtain them, as well as removing the resource server&#39;s need
   to understand a wide range of authentication methods.</p>

<p>Access tokens can have different formats, structures, and methods of
   utilization (e.g., cryptographic properties) based on the resource
   server security requirements.  Access token attributes and the
   methods used to access protected resources are beyond the scope of
   this specification and are defined by companion specifications such
   as</p>

<hr>

<h1 id="refreshing-an-access-token">Refreshing an Access Token</h1>

<p>Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh
   tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are
   used to obtain a new access token when the current access token
   becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens
   with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter
   lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource
   owner).  Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the
   authorization server.  If the authorization server issues a refresh
   token, it is included when issuing an access token (i.e., step (D) in
   Figure 1).</p>

<p>A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to
   the client by the resource owner.  The string is usually opaque to
   the client.  The token denotes an identifier used to retrieve the   authorization information.  Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are
   intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent
   to resource servers.</p>

<p>The flow illustrated in Figure 2 includes the following steps:</p>

<p>(A)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the

<p>(B)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token
        and a refresh token.</p>

<p>(C)  The client makes a protected resource request to the resource
        server by presenting the access token.</p>

<p>(D)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.</p>

<p>(E)  Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires.  If the
        client knows the access token expired, it skips to step (G);
        otherwise, it makes another protected resource request.</p>

<p>(F)  Since the access token is invalid, the resource server returns
        an invalid token error.</p>

<p>(G)  The client requests a new access token by authenticating with
        the authorization server and presenting the refresh token.  The
        client authentication requirements are based on the client type
        and on the authorization server policies.</p>

<p>(H)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
